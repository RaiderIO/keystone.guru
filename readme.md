# About Keystone.guru
Keystone.guru is a website where users can build and find their favorite routes for completing in Mythic Plus in World of Warcraft®: Shadowlands™.
This repository contains the source code of (most parts of) the website. It is built with [Laravel 8.0](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) using [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [PHP](http://www.php.net/) and [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/).
It uses a ton of other libraries such as Leaflet for map displaying, Puppeteer for thumbnail generation, REDIS for cache, Laravel Echo Server for real-time communication and much, much more.

The website is free to use, now and forever. You may support the development of this website by becoming a Patron on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/keystoneguru).
