The map view will now also display an ad. I realise nobody likes ads, but they're necessary to pay the bills. You're free to use an adblocker however, I've made sure it should be easy to block them if you so desire. Alternatively, becoming a patron on https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/keystoneguru will also remove all ads for $1 a month. Feedback always welcome, and thanks for your understanding!",
