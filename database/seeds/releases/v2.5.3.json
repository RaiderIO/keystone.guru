I'm looking to refine these further, but they're in Keystone.guru style now.\n    * #185 Interally reworked the way affixes and affix groups are handled (a group is pretty much an affix set that you encounter every week). This now works with M+ Seasons, allowing for cleaner code and making it very easy to add new affixes\/seasons. The only change for you is that the \/affixes page will be more accurate going into the future, around the weeks where a new season is announced.\n    *  As part of the above tickets, I've also fixed an issue that was introduced with the introduction of Teams where filtering Routes on the \/routes page or in your profile, teams pages would no longer work. This has been corrected.\nMap changes:\n    * #188 Finishing deleting an object (or cancelling it) will no longer remove all raid markers from view. A refresh would bring them back, but that's not ideal of course.\n    * #190 Demo routes now properly have group player specializations and attributes.\n    * #191 Changing drawing color now properly changes the color of drawn Paths.\n    * #192 Floor switcher is now initialized on the current floor, plus using it to change floors now always works.",
