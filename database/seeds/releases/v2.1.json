This results in a good performance increase now and especially going into the future as the amount user-generated Routes keep growing.\n* #85 Reduced the amount of requests upon startup, increasing the speed at which the page loads, especially for those not situated in Europe.\n* #110 Pre-compiled most Handlebars templates. Increases performance and reduces load on the local machine.\n* #132 Any new Route that you create would not save its affixes; this has been resolved (some time ago already, but it's in this release now).\n* #124 Revamped the menu while on mobile. It looks a lot better now.\n* #133 When you delete a Route it's now cleaned up more thoroughly.\n\nMap changes:\n* #88 Routes are now called Paths. The term 'Route' was ambiguous with your entire run, which is also called a Route. Now the entire plannable dungeon is called a Route, the path which you take is comprised of Paths.\n\nMapping changes:\n*  Various packs that enemies can be part of have been corrected. Some enemies were not part of a pack when they should've been, or were part of the wrong pack.\n*  Fixed an issue in Waycrest Manor in The Catacombs that caused Javascript errors, leading to potentially unresponsive pages.",
