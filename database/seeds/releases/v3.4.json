Also, various minor bugs have been fixed in the process of this rewrite.\n    * #204 Enemy packs are no longer sometimes drawn multiple times when switching floors, leading to a layered polygon with ever increasing opacity.\n    * #413 Raid marker assigning (using right click on an enemy) now works again.\n    * #414 Switching floors while actively drawing lines will no longer result in a cascade of \"Finish\" lines, eventually clogging up the entire screen if you let it go that far.\n    * #358 Internal change to make sure client and server are more up-to-date with one another.\nMDT importer changes:\n    * #390 By ConnerS: if a pull that is imported from MDT were to be empty when importing it in Keystone.guru, the importer would skip the pull altogether. However, this would create a gap in your pull indices, for example: 1, 2, 4, 5 (where 3 would be a pull that was removed). This has been fixed so the counter properly increments as expected.\nTeam changes:\n    * #416 If you received an invite link for a team you're already a part of, the 'Return to Team' button would produce a 404 not found error.",
