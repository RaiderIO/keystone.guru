Because of this, raid markers no longer completely replace the selected enemy, but place the marker to the top of them instead (just like in-game).",

Using the new dropdown for visualization selection in the top right you can select a new 'Infested Voting' visualization, which allows you to vote yes or no on each enemy on-screen if they're infested or not. Each enemy requires 3 more yes votes than no votes to be marked as Infested on everyone's map. Every reset, the votes are cleared and the voting begins again (Infested enemies change every week).   To vote for Infested enemies, you need to have your region and timezone set in your profile. Why? As a European you can vote for Infested enemies on Tuesday afternoon, while Americas will have a new set of Infested enemies already and they're voting for theirs. You don't want your 'last week' votes messing up the 'new' votes for the next week that are already being voted for in America.",
