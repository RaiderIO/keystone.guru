Does the route contain Warlock Demonic Gateway skips, but you can't do these because your group does not run with a Warlock? If the author has flagged their Route with the appropriate attributes you can now filter out Routes that contain a Warlock Demonic Gateway skip. There are currently attributes for Rogue Shroud, Warlock Gate skips, Mage Slow Fall skip (Shrine of the Storm), Invisibility Potion and Death skip. If you have more ideas for attributes please let me know and I will consider adding them.",
