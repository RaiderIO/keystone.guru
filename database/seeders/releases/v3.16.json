Unpublished remains as it was - only you may view the current route. A new option will be 'Team', where all members of teams you are part of may view the route (and noone else). 'World' will allow your route to be viewed by everyone and it will be featured on the Routes page of the website. Finally, 'World with Link' is available for Patrons, which will allow you to make your routes viewable by everyone if they have the link. This replaces the 'Unlisted route' option.",
