Sanguine Depths before second boss, the anti-clockwise route to the boss may have missing Inspired enemies. Spires of Ascension going left after the first boss. Mists of Tirna Scithe maze south route and past the maze boss on the right may not be accurate. These are either random or very unpopular routes so they shouldn't affect most people. I'll await more footage showing up so I can add these areas too.",
