##Setting up Laravel Echo Server

###Install Laravel Echo Server
`npm install -g laravel-echo-server`

###Install Redis Server
`sudo apt install redis-server`

Make sure it's running:

`service redis start`

To verify:

`redis-cli ping`

should be replied with `PONG`.

###Run Laravel Echo Server
Supervisor handles running echo server.

`laravel-echo-server start --config="<config.json>"`

###Modify .env
`BROADCAST_DRIVER=redis`

###Apache2 proxy
(Note I run the server on port 6002)

Enable modules:

`a2enmod proxy`

`a2enmod proxy_balancer`

`a2enmod proxy_http`

`a2enmod proxy_wstunnel`

`a2enmod lbmethod_byrequests`

```apacheconfig
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/socket.io            [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} transport=websocket    [NC]
RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://localhost:6002/$1 [P,L]
ProxyPass        /socket.io http://localhost:6002/socket.io
ProxyPassReverse /socket.io http://localhost:6002/socket.io
```

###nginx proxy
The config should go between the `charset` and the `location /` parts.
```nginxconfig
charset utf-8;

location /socket.io {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6002;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}

location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

###API Clients
Clients are saved in the `laravel-echo-server.json` config file. The HTTP API is always open,
no easy way for me to close it down. As such, everyone can access the the API if they have
the client password. These passwords are saved in the .json file, which I want to version.
I cannot version them because of the passwords. To solve this, every time `./update_live.sh`
is ran, a new password is generated and written to each config file. The passwords that are 
committed to the repository will NOT work ever since they get overwritten to a new one every
update.
